# pocre
Precise OCR engine

pocre is a highly adjustable, real-time optical character recognition engine designed to recognize text with 100% precision. The extreme accuracy comes at a cost of low versitality, as a trained pocre isn't meant to recognize different types of fonts, text styles, or even work with non-standarized background.
